# islr-python

This project is a python adaptation of the lab example in 
"Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"
by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. 

Some of the original adaptations were produced by J. Warmenhoven, and updated by R. Jordan Crouser at Smith College for
SDS293: Machine Learning (Spring 2016).
